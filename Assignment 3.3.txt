List the components of hadoop2.X and explain each component in detail.
    1 Yarn
    2 HDFS
    3 Map Reduce
 

  * Yarn:
       - Yarn is  Yet Another Resource negotiator
       - Yarn is used to split up the rfuctionalities of resource managemnt and job scheduling into seperate daemons.
       - It is one of the key features of the hadoop.
       - It is a large scale distributed operating system.
  * HDFS:
      - HDFS is a java based file system and it provides scalable and reliable data storage.
      - HDFs splits the file into smaller files before processing and files are also replicated into different servers.
      - HDFS allows Multiple Name nodes.
      - Namenode and datanode are used by users to check the status of clusters.
      - Hadoop 2.x allows HDFS to be in available in which it is active and stand by name node. 
      - Streaming data access,Huge datasets,fault detection and recovery are goals of hdfs.
  * Map Reduce:
      - Map Reduce is used for scheduling and processing the data.
      - Map and Reduce are two important functions in MapReduce.
      - Resource manager and node manager are important components in Map Reduce
      - Resource Manager:
         * This process runs on master node.
         * It's Main responsibility is to make client to submit it's job and to monitor jobs on cluster.
         * It allocates Proper resources to slave node.
         * It talks with Node manager to know the resource utilization.
      - Node Manager:
         * This process runs on slave node.
         * It makes resoucre manger to do resource utilization and job scheduling.
         * It reports resource manager about resource utilization.
         * It uses some other process like application master and container to do map reduce jobs.
